In this analysis I am finding out peoples sentiment about Exams.
People always have both types of sentiments about exams.They can be happy or sad based on the exam schedule,examination break,
results or on completion.

collect.py(Collecting training and test data)
I am collecting tweets which has exams using search API of twitter and classifying them as 
Positive and negative sentiment based on train data which will be used to train model.
Also I am testing my model based on the test data collected from twitter
to find out how efficient my model is.

Note:Please run the collect.py until it completes so that we can fetch both training and testing data.It takes only few minutes.
If halted in between and testing data is not fetched then classify.py will not work since we are predicting sentiments based on the testing data.  

cluster.py       	
In cluster.py I am finding out users who has tweeted about the exam and using there id 
From this information I am creating graph which will show me different clusters based on  
girvan newman algorithm. Using this information I am finding out average user per community and total number of community. 

classify.py
In classify.py I am finding out positive and negative sentiments of people from tweets collected.
For finding out different sentiments(positive/negative) of people,I am training my model using train data which 
is classified using AFINN. Using my model on testing data, I am predicting the tweets representing positive or negative sentiments.
